# Preprocessing

This directory contains all the scripts necessary to preprocess the text data scraped from different sources. While the main.py and main.ipynb are mostly identical (one is designed to run on the dgx), the techniques.py and utilities.py contain helper functions, while the generatePlots_afterFiltering.py and generatePlots_afterPreprocessing.py generate plots for each step to visualize the process.

### data
Directory in which the preprocessed data will be saved.

### models
Directory containing models and dictionaries used for preprocessing.

### plots
Directory containing the plots generated by the scripts.
